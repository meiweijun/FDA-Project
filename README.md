- **Data Integrity**  
  Immutable storage of approval records as PDF/A files with cryptographic hashes.
- **Access Control**  
  Enforces Azure AD authentication and role-based permissions.

### **Core Functionality**
- **Signature Capture**  
  Pen-based signature input via Power Apps (`PenInput` control).
- **Document Management**  
  Securely upload and store documents in SharePoint with version control.
